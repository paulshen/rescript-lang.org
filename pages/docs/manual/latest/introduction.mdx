# ReScript

ReScript looks like JavaScript, works like JavaScript, works _with_ JavaScript, and outputs to the highest quality of clean, readable and performant JavaScript. The big difference is that ReScript comes with a bulletproof type system, a solid build system, and a couple of extra features that'd make JavaScript users envious.

Thanks to its great interoperability with JS, ReScript can be seen as a "gradually" typed language, where you get to incrementally adopt it in your codebase file-by-file, while keeping the full benefits of a 100% sound and reliable type system, plus extra language features.

## Why Compile to JavaScript?

JavaScript's ecosystem and community are very vibrant and active. The language itself is unparalleled in terms of adoption & distribution. Compiling to JavaScript is a therefore pragmatic choice (and sometimes, the only choice).

Additionally, the JavaScript VMs also received many engineering-years of fine-tuning and get faster all the time.

## Why ReScript?

_"Why not just use nothing but JavaScript then?"_

Despite its clear advantages, JavaScript does present a few drawbacks. Here's how ReScript solves them.

### Reliability

ReScript's type system alone offers three major benefits to make your programs more reliable:

- **Sound type system**. "Sound" here means that the types _guarantee_ that they are what they are, not just 90% of the time. Once a ReScript project compiles, there are no runtime type errors. \*
- **Strong type inference**. Almost the entirety of the language can be inferred. You don't have to tediously write all the types manually. Feel free to still type out some parts for readability!
- **Expressive type features**. With well-thought-out features like [variants](variant.md), [pattern matching](pattern-matching-destructuring.md) and [modules](module.md), the types guide you through your iteration process and don't block you from expressing what you need.

The combination of these highlights, along with other type system features, unlocks new workflow possibilities and is something existing gradual typing solutions for JavaScript don't offer.

\* The exceptions are some deliberate, optional interoperability hooks.

### High Quality Dead Code Elimination

The JavaScript ecosystem is very reliant on dependencies, and quite often many of them. Shipping the final product inevitably drags in a huge amount of code, lots of which the project doesn't actually use. These regions of dead code impact loading, parsing and interpretation speed. ReScript provides powerful dead code elimination at all
levels:

- Function and module level code elimination is facilitated by the well-engineered type system and **purity analysis**.
- At the global level, ReScript generates code that are naturally friendly to dead code elimination done by bundling tools such as [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) and [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/), after its own sophisticated elimination pass.
- The same applies for ReScript's own tiny runtime (which is written in ReScript itself).

### Compile-time Optimizations

JavaScript is a dynamic language; it takes a performance hit when the browser engine optimizes code at runtime. While some engines circumvent the problem to some extent by [caching](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2015/07/code-caching.html), this isn't always available nor predictable. The lack of a strong, built-in type system also limits the amount of optimizations possible. ReScript, on the other hand, is able to provide many optimizations during compilation time, way before the code's shipped to the browser. A widespread adage to write fast JavaScript code is to write as if there's a type system (in order to trigger JS engines' good optimization heuristics); ReScript gives you a real one and generates code that's friendly to optimizations by default.

## How Is ReScript Different?

Nowadays, there are many languages out there that compile to JavaScript. ReScript distinguishes itself from the alternatives in a few crucial ways.

### Fast Iteration Loop

ReScript's build time is **one or two orders of magnitude** faster than alternatives. In its watcher mode, the build system usually finishes before you switch screen from the editor to the terminal tab (two digits of milliseconds). A fast iteration cycle reduces need of keeping one's mental state around longer; this in turns allows one to stay in the flow longer and more often.

### Readable Output & Great Interop

Unreadable JavaScript code generated from other compiled-to-js languages makes it so that it could be, practically speaking:

- Hard to debug (cryptic stack trace, mangled variable names)
- Hard to learn from (non-straightforward mapping of concepts from one language to another)
- Hard to profile for performance (unclear what runtime performance cost there is)
- Hard to integrate with existing hand-written JS code

<!-- TODO: playground link -->

ReScript's JS output is very readable. This is especially important while learning, where users might want to understand how the code's compiled, and to audit for bugs.

<!-- TODO: link to interop -->

This characteristic, combined with a fully-featured JS interop system, allows ReScript code to be inserted into an existing JavaScript codebase almost unnoticed.

### Tiny JS Output

<!-- TODO: playground link -->

A `Hello world` ReScript program generates **20 bytes** JS code. Additionally, the standard library pieces you require in are only include when needed.

### Preservation of Code Structure

ReScript maps one source file to one JavaScript output file. This eases the integration of existing tools such as bundlers and test runners. You can even start writing a single file without much change your build setup. Each file's code structure is approximately preserved, too.
